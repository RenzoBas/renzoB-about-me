<h1>Hello everyone, my name is Renzo Basurco</h1>

<!--Who are you?-->
<p class = "para">I am currently 16 years old and turning 17 soon, I have completed my junior year this year and am moving on to become a senior. I am currently in my first year of TXT (Teens Exploring Technology). I enjoy anime and video games, because of the creative ways they have put stories, I really like the story-teling, and not just limited to those two, I love good story-telling and expressive art in general. I also like helping people, it helps me learn as well as helping others learn as well, I would help people with drawing, homework, writing, organizing, etc. (and now sometimes coding.)</p>

<!--Who do you want to become? -->
<p class = "para">I am learning TXT, I am drawing, and I listen to music, because in the future, I strive to become a video game developer. I want to become successful in the future, success to me means being happy with what I do in life. Even with success, I still want to continue learning and improving upon myself. With the TXT program I also want to learn how to become a leader, I am learning how to stand up more and participate more, it makes me comfortable to share my ideas within TXT.</p>

<!--Hobbies and Interests-->
<p class = "para">My hobbies right now are: cooking, drawing, swimming, playing on the guitar and keyboard, working out, and now coding. My interests right now include watching anime and other TV shows, most Nintendo video games (I'm excited for Xenoblade Chronicles 3!), listening to music, watching videos to expand my knowledge, learning coding through TXT, and I have not much else to say about this, but I am very interested in these subjects. I don't think I might ever grow out of video games in my life even when I am old because I just really love video games so much, they inspire me a lot!</p>
